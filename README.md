# Decimal-to-Hex

Decimal and hexadecimal are two number systems commonly used in computing. Decimal is the base-10 system, while hexadecimal is the base-16 system.

In the decimal system, numbers are represented using ten digits, ranging from 0 to 9. In the hexadecimal system, numbers are represented using 16 digits, ranging from 0 to 9 and from A to F. The hexadecimal digits represent the values 10 to 15 in the decimal system.

To convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number, we divide the decimal number by 16 repeatedly and write down the remainder at each step. When we get a quotient of zero, we stop. The hexadecimal number is formed by writing the remainders in reverse order.

For example, to convert the decimal number 203 to hexadecimal, we divide it by 16 repeatedly:


    203 รท 16 = 12 remainder 11 (B in hexadecimal)
    12 รท 16 = 0 remainder 12 (C in hexadecimal)

So, the hexadecimal representation of 203 is CB.

To convert decimal to hexadecimal, we can write a program in any programming language that implements this process. The program takes an input decimal number and returns its corresponding hexadecimal representation. The implementation may differ depending on the programming language used.

For example, in Python, we can write a program like this:


    def decimal_to_hexadecimal(decimal):
        hex_digits = "0123456789ABCDEF"
        hexadecimal = ""
        while decimal > 0:
            remainder = decimal % 16
            hexadecimal = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal
            decimal = decimal // 16
        return hexadecimal
        
This program defines a function decimal_to_hexadecimal that takes an input decimal number and returns its hexadecimal representation. The function initializes a string hex_digits containing the hexadecimal digits, and an empty string hexadecimal to store the result. The function then repeatedly divides the decimal number by 16, computes the remainder, and appends the corresponding hexadecimal digit to the result string. Finally, the function returns the result string.

To use this program, we can call the function and pass it a decimal number as an argument, like this:


    print(decimal_to_hexadecimal(203)) # Output: CB
  
Similar programs can be written in other programming languages, such as Java, C++, or JavaScript. The process of converting decimal to hexadecimal is a fundamental operation in computer science and programming, and is used in many applications, such as color codes, memory addresses, and cryptographic algorithms.
